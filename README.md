# Inferential-Statistics---Coded-Project

## Overview
This project allows us to apply concepts of probability like Bayes theorem, probability distributions and hypothesis testing for solving questions based on cases given to us. 
Example - 

The breaking strength of gunny bags used for packaging cement is normally distributed with a mean of 5 kg per sq. centimeter and a standard deviation of 1.5 kg per sq. centimeter. The quality team of the cement company wants to know the following about the packaging material to better understand wastage or pilferage within the supply chain; Answer the questions below based on the given information; (Provide an appropriate visual representation of your answers, without which marks will be deducted)

2.1 What proportion of the gunny bags have a breaking strength of less than 3.17 kg per sq cm?

2.2 What proportion of the gunny bags have a breaking strength of at least 3.6 kg per sq cm.?

2.3 What proportion of the gunny bags have a breaking strength between 5 and 5.5 kg per sq cm.?

2.4 What proportion of the gunny bags have a breaking strength NOT between 3 and 7.5 kg per sq cm.?

## Features 
**NumPy**: Uses the NumPy library in Python to execute arithmetic operations.
